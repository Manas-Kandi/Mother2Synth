# Copilot Instructions â€“ Motherâ€‘2 Synthesis Agent

## ðŸ§  About This Project

This project is called **Motherâ€‘2 Synthesis Agent**. It is a self-hosted tool that turns raw UX research transcripts into a visual whiteboard of themes, journeys, quotes, and opportunities. The end goal involves LLM agents, a tldraw-based canvas, and a pipeline architectureâ€”but we are not there yet.

## ðŸ§­ How Weâ€™re Building This

We are taking an intentionally **slow, controlled, minimal-first approach**. We are not scaffolding the full system or writing speculative code. Instead:

- We are building one **tiny, testable feature at a time**
- Each step must **work independently** before we move on
- We prefer clarity over abstraction
- We do not optimize, generalize, or restructure until necessary

## âœ… What You Should Do

- Help build **small features** with clean, modular code
- Focus on **just what we ask for**â€”no more, no less
- Use simple, readable logic and meaningful names
- Add light comments or `TODO:` markers when something is incomplete

## ðŸš« What You Should Avoid

- Do not anticipate future features or folder structures
- Do not suggest routing, state libraries, or database code unless explicitly requested
- Do not scaffold or generate entire pipelines, boards, or LLM chains
- Do not combine multiple responsibilities into one function or component

## ðŸ§˜ Style Philosophy

- Keep functions and components small and focused
- Use plain language and clear docstrings
- Leave abstractions for laterâ€”code for understanding first
- If uncertain, leave a placeholder or `TODO:` rather than guessing
