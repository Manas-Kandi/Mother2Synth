Speaker 1: I usually go through the app but not always. Sometimes I just use the website if I'm already on my computer.
Speaker 2: Okay and when you log in what usually happens
Speaker 1: Sometimes it's fine but other times it says wrong password even though I KNOW it's not wrong like I literally copy-paste it from my notes
Speaker 2: Got it—
Speaker 1: Yeah and then I try the reset thing but then no email comes and I'm like ?? hello??
Speaker 2: Right and how does that affect your work or whatever
Speaker 1: Oh yeah uh I just give up usually like I don't have time to deal with that sometimes the site freezes too or it just doesn't click when you press stuff like it lags and I don't know if it went through or not
Speaker 2: Ok and that happens like often?
Speaker 1: I don't know yeah I guess like once or twice a week maybe
Speaker 2: Oh oh and one time I was filling out this form thing and got a call and came back and like it was GONE no autosave or anything
Speaker 1: Not sure
Speaker 3: What about when you try to access it on your phone?
Speaker 1: Oh my friend doesn’t have these issues but he’s on iPhone so maybe it’s an Android thing?
Speaker 3: Hmm interesting
Speaker 4: Have you tried reaching out to support?
Speaker 1: Nah I just deal with it
Speaker 3: Maybe you should try clearing your cache
Speaker 1: I don’t know how to do that
Speaker 2: That's a good point
Speaker 3: Yeah I think that might help
Speaker 1: I'll try that next time
Speaker 4: Thanks for sharing your experience
Speaker 1: No problem
Speaker 3: This has been really helpful
Speaker 1: Glad I could help
