SPEAKER 1: so um I usually go through the app but not always. Sometimes I just use the website if I'm already on my computer.

INTERVIEWER: Okay, and when you log in, what usually happens?

SPEAKER 1: Like sometimes it’s fine, but other times it says wrong password even though I KNOW it’s not wrong. Like I literally copy-paste it from my notes.

INTERVIEWER: Got it.

SPEAKER 1: Yeah, and then I try the reset thing, but then no email comes and I’m like, ?? hello?? [laughs] Sometimes it works but not consistently.

INTERVIEWER: Right, and how does that affect your work or whatever?

SPEAKER 1: Oh yeah, uh, I just give up usually, like I don’t have time to deal with that. Sometimes the site freezes too or it just doesn’t click when you press stuff. Like it lags and I don’t know if it went through or not.

INTERVIEWER: Okay, and that happens like often?

SPEAKER 1: Idk, yeah, I guess like once or twice a week maybe. Oh, oh, and one time I was filling out this form thing and got a call and came back and like it was GONE. No autosave or anything.

INTERVIEWER: Yeah, wow, okay.

SPEAKER 1: Also, my friend doesn’t have these issues, but he’s on iPhone, so maybe it’s an Android thing? Not sure.
