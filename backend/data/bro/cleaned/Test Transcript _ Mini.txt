SPEAKER 1: so um I usually go through the app but not always sometimes I just use the website if I'm already on my computer
INTERVIEWER: okay and when you log in what usually happens
SPEAKER 1: like sometimes it’s fine but other times it says wrong password even though I KNOW it’s not wrong like I literally copy paste it from my notes
INTERVIEWER: got it—
SPEAKER 1: yeah and then I try the reset thing but then no email comes and I’m like ?? hello?? [laughs] sometimes it works but not consistently
INTERVIEWER: right, and how does that affect your work or whatever
SPEAKER 1: oh yeah uh I just give up usually like I don’t have time to deal with that. Sometimes the site freezes too or it just doesn’t click when you press stuff like it lags and I don’t know if it went through or not.
INTERVIEWER: ok and that happens like often?
SPEAKER 1: idk yeah I guess like once or twice a week maybe. Oh oh and one time I was filling out this form thing and got a call and came back and like it was GONE. No autosave or anything.
INTERVIEWER: yeah wow ok
SPEAKER 1: also my friend doesn’t have these issues but he’s on iPhone so maybe it’s an Android thing? Not sure.
